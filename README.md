# Description
The coffee scale allows you to plug your scale into your pi and get a reading on your computer console of the weight of coffee in grams.
If someone empties the pot their picture is taken. If they don't refil the pot their picture is sent off the to a backend. Once the pot is eventually refilled the process can begin again.
